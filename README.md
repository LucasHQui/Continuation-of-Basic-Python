# Continuation-of-Basic-Python

This project involves the data analysis of a music streaming service to test a hypothesis about musical preferences in two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville 🎵🏙️.

The project is divided into three stages:

Data Overview 📊: You will explore the data and make observations.
Data Preprocessing 🧹: You will clean the data, including organizing column names and removing missing and duplicate values.
Hypothesis Testing 🧪: You will test the following hypothesis: "User activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city".
The data is stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv and includes information such as user ID, song title, artist, genre, user's city, time of day when the song was played, and the day of the week 🗂️.
